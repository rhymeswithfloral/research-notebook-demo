Module 2
CWGC
Search Term: "Snoddy"
Data Location: CWGCSnoddy.csv
URL: N/A (No defined URL for specific searchs)

Notes:
CWGC doesn't provide URL for specific searches because of how they built it with JavaScript. Therefore there is no unique URL for the search results.
Even so, working around this step in the module can be done by simply conducting the search within OutWit Hub's browser interface. Unfortunately, a large portion of the data on the page is the JavaScript code.
Scrapping pages similar to this could result in having to sift through a great amount of extraneous information. An additional difficulty created by this digital database is that the search results are not given specific fields;
the individual results are divided by tables and the tables are given a class - even or odd. Therefore, it would no be possible to scrap only specific results.
