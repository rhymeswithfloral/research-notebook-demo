            <p>...ation of this terrific subject very naturally leads our ingenious <persName key="Hall, Francis" from="Unknown-1833" role="Lieutenant" ref="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Hall%2C%20Francis%2C%20-1833">author</persName> to inquire how it has happened that "slavery and slave dealing," though exhibiting little either in speculation or practice, which is calculated to convince the judgement or captivate the affections, should have found advocates, not merely among slave-traders and slave-holders, but among men of cultivated, and apparently liberal, minds. Without any natural sympathy with cruelty, and without any interest in the question, they still defend these hideous practices, as if they were worthy of being embraced and cherished for the sake of their own native loveliness.<interp key="References Hall to highlight the hypocrisy of the arguments used in pro-slavery arguments" n="Hall, Francis, d. 1833.

            <p>"As such persons scarceky affect to reason, or inquire, it is difficult to discover on what grounds they rest their opinions: the few who pretend to speak from experience, have seldom more urge than the experience of good West-India dinners; and how can any thing be wrong where people dine so well? The many, who have made up their minds by mere dint of not thinking on the matter, take fast hold upon some one of the many bold falsehoods, or skilful sophisms, with which those interested in the traffic are ever ready to furnish such as find it troublesome, or fancy it unsafe, too use their own understandings;--as for instance--' Negro slaves are better off than the poorer classes in many...'"</p>
