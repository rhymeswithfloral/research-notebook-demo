Notes:
I followed the steps to build the folder from scratch using GitBash, CoreUtils and Wget, however when I went entered "canadiana-2.sh" into GitBash there was no response.
I watched Profressor Graham's video about the Canadiana API excercise and attempted again using the zipped folder he created, but once again there was no response from GitBash.
At this point I decided to start fresh and work from scratch again and created another folder for Module 2 but once again - no response.
However, when I double clicked on "canadiana-2.sh" in my Module 2 folder the program started.
